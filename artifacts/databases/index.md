# Databases Artifact

## Overview

The artifact I selected for the Databases outcome is my **Travlr Getaways** full-stack web application, built with the **MEAN stack** (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js). This project originally served as a travel booking system but was enhanced during CS-499 to demonstrate advanced database design, secure storage, and data-driven personalization. I chose this artifact because it clearly demonstrates my ability to design, query, and optimize a database to support scalable and secure application functionality. It also shows how back-end data structures drive intelligent features like recommendations and event tracking.

## What I Improved

The database enhancements focused on strengthening **data security, structure, and integration** between the back end and front end. They support the **Databases Outcome** by showing how I improved the structure, security,
and organization of stored data to make the system more reliable and scalable. 

**Key updates included:**

- Restructured the **MongoDB user schema** to include `pastTrips` for storing user travel history.
  
- Designed a new **eventLog collection** to capture and categorize user activity such as logins, 2FA events, and system updates.
  
- Implemented **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** and **recovery codes**, ensuring that all secrets are encrypted or hashed before being stored.
   
- Added **login rate limiting** and **event persistence** to link user behavior to database records for auditing.
  
- Optimized queries used in the **recommendation feature** to generate personalized suggestions based on previous trips.  

These updates improved the reliability, traceability, and overall performance of the application while following industry best practices for **database normalization, indexing, and data protection**.

## Code Review Notes

These enhancements were informed by the same **code review** used to identify improvements across authentication, logging, and schema design. The review confirmed that database interactions lacked consistent logging and that sensitive user data required stronger encryption and structure.

**Key improvements based on review:**

- Introduced a dedicated `eventLog` model for structured auditing.
   
- Updated `user.js` schema with additional fields and encryption logic.
   
- Ensured all authentication events write to the database for traceability.
  
- Applied indexes and query optimization to improve retrieval times for trips and user history.

## Reflection

This enhancement demonstrates my ability to **design and manage databases that are secure, efficient, and adaptable**. By implementing stronger schemas and logging mechanisms, I created a system capable of supporting both real-time functionality and administrative insights.

The process deepened my understanding of:

- Balancing data structure flexibility with performance.
   
- Implementing encryption, hashing, and indexing for secure, optimized queries.
  
- Integrating databases seamlessly with front-end features like personalized recommendations.  

These improvements directly support my professional goals in **cybersecurity and system architecture**, where secure, well-structured data systems are critical.
